abstract = {We derive the value of reliability in the scheduling of an activity of random duration, such as travel under congested conditions. Using a simple formulation of scheduling utility, we show that the maximal expected utility is linear in the mean and standard deviation of trip duration, regardless of the form of the standardised distribution of trip durations. This insight provides a unification of the scheduling model and models that include the standard deviation of trip duration directly as an argument in the cost or utility function. The results generalise approximately to the case where the mean and standard deviation of trip duration depend on the starting time. An empirical illustration is provided.}

abstract = {The reliability of travel time significantly affects individual travelers’ decision-making behaviour and hence in turn influences the overall travel demand at the macroscopic level. The travel time reliability ratio (TTRR), defined to be the ratio of the value of travel time variability to the value of travel time, is an important metric for measuring such reliability. In this paper, we first show that the TTRR is closely related to a widely used risk measure in financial economics, i.e. conditional value at risk (CVaR). Then based on the connection between the TTRR and CVaR, we develop a nonparametric approach to estimate the TTRR. In the literature, to compute the TTRR, it usually needs to assume a specific statistical distribution for the travel time. This can produce a misleading result when this assumption goes awry due to the potential complexity of travel time distributions. Based on the relationship between the TTRR and CVaR, this paper proposes a new nonparametric method, i.e. the kernel density estimation method, to overcome this problem. We show that this new nonparametric method is robust in terms that it does not depend on any assumptions about the shape of the travel time distribution. The simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and substantially improves the numerical accuracy. Finally, a practical example is used to illustrate the proposed method.}

In risk quantification in finance, climatology and many other applications, however, the interest lies in capturing the tail variations rather than variation around the mean. To this end, we develop Principal Expectile Analysis (PEC), which generalizes PCA for expectiles. It can be seen as a dimension reduction tool for extreme-value theory, where fluctuations in the τ-expectile level of the data are approximated by a low-dimensional subspace. We provide algorithms based on iterative least squares, derive bounds on their convergence time, and compare their performance through simulations. We apply the algorithms to a Chinese weather dataset and fMRI data from an investment decision study.}

    abstract = { Although reliability of travel modes has generally been found to be one of the most important attributes of transportation systems, few attempts have been made to make these findings operational. The impact of a specific measure of reliability, the variability of travel time, on the route-to-work choice is investigated in this research through the use of a survey instrument posing hypothetical commute alternatives. A mean-variance model of travel choice is used to estimate an individual's tradeoff between time and variability (i.e., risk aversion). The principal tool of analysis was LINMAP, a linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preferences, which yielded estimates of each respondent's risk aversion coefficient (λ). A pretest was conducted to determine an appropriate format for the commute choices and to investigate external validity concerns. }

    abstract = { Travelers sometimes experience extremely long travel times on a route. The Travel Simulator Laboratory (TSL) of Delft University of Technology is used to study the effect of these extreme experiences on route choice. The TSL allows for a completely controlled experiment and good research methodology. It is hypothesized that together with the average travel time and the variance, the most extreme travel times experienced influence a person's perception of the attractiveness of the route. Travel information is assumed to be able to alter this perception. Data from 2,500 respondents were gathered with the TSL. Route switching behavior after a regular experience and after an extreme experience was analyzed. People switched routes after an extreme experience significantly more often when the information that they received before the route choice was wrong than they did when it was correct. Moreover, travelers clearly preferred a route that is sometimes bad and most of the time good over a route that is symmetrically distributed with a large variance and thus less predictable. Furthermore, mixed multinomial logit models for panel data were estimated. Expected travel time, expected variance, and worst experience were found to be negatively valued. The posed hypothesis seems to be correct on a qualitative level and proves to be a promising field of research. However, much work still has to be done on the mathematical model to draw more specific conclusions on a quantitative level as well. }

However, there have been few research efforts relating real-time traffic flow parameters and weather conditions for different levels of heavy vehicle traffic. This study aims at establishing relationships between speed and volume in freeway sections using Remote Traffic Microwave Sensor (RTMS) data as a function of weather conditions. Historical weather and RTMS detector data (i.e., volume and speed) from two highway corridors in the Istanbul metropolitan area are used for this purpose. Empirical relationships between traffic speed and volume are analyzed by weather condition (clear, rain, fog/mist/haze, or snow), surface condition (dry, wet, or icy), and percentage of heavy vehicles in the traffic mix. The findings from the analysis show that rain reduced the average vehicular speeds by 8 to 12% and the capacity by 7-8%. Moreover, wet surface conditions resulted in a reduction of average speeds by 6 to 7% and light snow affected demand leading to a significant reduction in traffic volume.}

The speed and density distribution of microscopic parameters about freeway traffic flow under different rains was researched, and the highway two-regime speed density distribution traffic flow model under different rainfall weather conditions was calibrated. Besides, the weather influence coefficient that the rainfall intensity and visibility affect the freeway traffic flow model parameters was determined through regression analysis. The research indicates that it has an greater influence on the maximum highway volume and free flow speed as the rainfall intensity increases. Compared with the normal weather, the maximum flow rate decreases15.7%, 19.1%, 32.5% respectively and the free flow speed decreases 4.4%, 7.3%,10.6% respectively because of light rain, moderate rain and heavy rain weather conditions.

The study site is located in a cold region highway in Alberta, Canada. The road-weather and traffic data collection devices are located alongside, permitting accurate measurement and association of exact pertaining road-weather and traffic conditions. The study has two main objectives: i) to investigate and model the impacts of road-weather events on the free-flow speed of vehicles, and ii) to explore the variability in models caused by adopting different data treatment methods. Linear and nonlinear regression models were developed with separate models for light and heavy vehicles travelling in shoulder and median lanes. Linear regression models developed with 20-minute aggregated free-flow speeds as dependent variable was found to be the best performing model for describing drivers’ choice of desired speed under adverse road-weather conditions. The study results revealed that slight, moderate and heavy snow will respectively reduce the free-flow speed of light vehicles travelling in the shoulder lane by 0.2%, 3.4% and 0.8%, and by 0.3%, 0.4% and 1.5% when travelling in the median lane. Moreover, heavy vehicles travelling in slight, moderate and heavy snow were estimated to reduce their desired speeds by 1.7%, 0.1% and 1.3% in shoulder lane while the reduction factors for those travelling in slight and moderate snow in median lane was 1.1% and 1% respectively. Estimated reduction factors for free-flow speed variations under adverse road-weather conditions found to be significantly smaller than HCM (2016) recommendations and the findings of other studies. These figures signify the importance of winter road maintenance in extremely cold regions. The frequent snow and ice removal as a result of winter road maintenance operations obviates the need for reducing desired speed and eventually results in less weather-related delays. The significance of driver familiarity with prevailing geographical conditions, i.e. winter driving was also highlighted when investigating the impact of inclement road-weather conditions on traffic operations.}

    abstract = { Travel time estimation models, which rely on speed data provided from point detectors (usually inductive loops), have application in travel time prediction and network performance monitoring. Unfortunately there are limited, and at times counterintuitive, results in the literature about their performance. This paper focuses on the field evaluation of four speed-based travel time estimation models, namely, the instantaneous model, the time slice model, the dynamic time slice model, and the linear model. Those models are evaluated using data from two operational motorways in Melbourne, Australia. Travel time estimation errors are quantified against actual travel times measured using a timed number plate survey and time-stamped toll tag data. There was little difference in the travel time estimation error across the models and they were all found to underestimate actual travel times. Errors ranged from about 7\% in the off peak up to 15\% in the peak. Marginal improvements in model performance were achieved through careful selection of which detectors provide input for each section (upstream, downstream, or the average of those values) and by conversion of the inputs from time mean speed to an estimate of space mean speed. }

    abstract = { Recent interest in modern regression modelling has focused on extending available (mean) regression models by describing more general properties of the response distribution. An alternative approach is quantile regression where regression effects on the conditional quantile function of the response are assumed. While quantile regression can be seen as a generalization of median regression, expectiles as alternative are a generalized form of mean regression.Generally, quantiles provide a natural interpretation even beyond the 0.5 quantile, the median. A comparable simple interpretation is not available for expectiles beyond the 0.5 expectile, the mean. Nonetheless, expectiles have some interesting properties, some of which are discussed in this article. We contrast the two approaches and show how to get quantiles from a fine grid of expectiles. We compare such quantiles from expectiles with direct quantile estimates regarding efficiency. We also look at regression problems where both quantile and expectile curves have the undesirable property that neighbouring curves may cross each other. We propose a modified method to estimate non-crossing expectile curves based on splines. In an application, we look at the expected shortfall, a risk measure used in finance, which requires both expectiles and quantiles for estimation and which can be calculated easily with the proposed methods in the article. }

    abstract = { Under relatively general assumptions a unique deterministic departure-time user equilibrium with a finite departure rate exists in the bottleneck model with drivers who differ in their unit costs of travel time, preferred times of arrival, and schedule delay cost functions. Existence requires that schedule delay cost functions be upper semicontinuous with respect to arrival time, and that schedule delay costs decline at a rate smaller than the unit cost of travel time. Uniqueness requires, more restrictively, that schedule delay cost functions be continuous. Several properties of equilibrium trip cost functions are derived for n groups of users with Ni in group i. The trip cost of a user in group i is a nondecreasing function of each Nj, but typically rises more quickly with respect to Ni than Nj, j≠i. Thus, users experience lower trip costs when they travel with users unlike themselves than with an equal number of users like themselves. }

It provides surprising insights about the time pattern of congestion, optimal pricing, and many distinct inefficiencies of unpriced equilibria including wrong departure order with heterogeneous preferences, wrong allocation of users across links of a network, and wrong order in which parking spaces are occupied. It illuminates the roles of travel-time reliability, traffic information, and extreme congestion (“hypercongestion”). It has been developed for use in practical network planning.

abstract = {Recent international research has seen the development of methods for the inclusion of travel time reliability as a separate factor in economic analysis of transportation projects, including the valuation of travel time variability. Fosgerau's valuation method includes the consideration of travel time reliability in cost-benefit analysis by adding travel time variability to the set of generalised travel costs. This requires: (1) a defined unit of measurement for travel time variability, (2) estimates of the quantity of travel time variability, and (3) identification of the cost to travellers per unit of travel time variability. The chosen unit of measurement is the standard deviation of the travel time distribution, and the value of this unit of measurement can be defined relative to the average value of travel time by a reliability ratio that depends on user preference parameters (related to risk aversion) and the shape of the upper tail of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the travel time distribution. This shape is represented by a definite integral of the inverse of the cdf. Determining the shape of the cdf and its inverse function is facilitated if the distribution can be defined by an explicit algebraic function. The Burr (type XII) distribution is one distribution with this feature, and has been used to successfully represent observed travel time data. This paper describes the Burr distribution, demonstrates that it can provide a good representation of observed travel time data, and explains how it can be used to develop an exact expression for the reliability ratio and thus can aid the use of the method for the valuation of travel time reliability.}

abstract = {The standard method of estimating the value of travel time variability for use in policy appraisal is to estimate the parameters of a reduced-form utility function, where some measure of travel time variability (such as the standard deviation) is included. A problem with this approach is that the obtained valuation will in general depend on the standardized travel time distribution, and hence cannot be transferred from one context to another. A recently suggested remedy for this problem has been to estimate a scheduling model, which in theory is transferrable, and use the implied reduced-form to derive valuations for use in appraisal. In this paper we estimate both a scheduling model and the implied reduced-form model, using stated choice data. The valuation of travel time variability implied by the scheduling model turns out to be substantially smaller than what is obtained from a reduced-form model estimated on the same sample. The results suggest that the scheduling model does not capture all of the disutility arising from travel time variability. Hence, although it can be shown that scheduling and reduced-form models are theoretically equivalent, that hypothesized equivalence is not reflected in the empirical evidence. We speculate that the derivation of reduced-form models from an underlying scheduling model omits two essential features: first, the notion of an exogenously fixed “preferred arrival time” neglects the fact that most activities can be rescheduled given full information about the travel times in advance, and second, disutility may be derived from uncertainty as such, in the form of anxiety, decisions costs or costs for having contingency plans. We also report our estimates of the valuation of travel time variability for public transit trips, for use in applied appraisal.}

    abstract = { Urban travel times are rather variable as a result of a lot of stochastic factors both in traffic flows, signals, and other conditions on the infrastructure. However, the most common way both in literature and practice is to estimate or predict only expected travel times, not travel time distributions. By doing so, it fails to provide full insight into the travel time dynamics and variability on urban roads. Another limitation of this common approach is that the effect of traffic measures on travel time reliability cannot be evaluated. In this paper, an analytical travel time distribution model is presented especially for urban roads with fixed-time controlled intersections by investigating the underlying mechanisms of urban travel times. Different from mean travel time models or deterministic travel time models, the proposed model takes stochastic properties of traffic flow, stochastic arrivals and departures at intersections, and traffic signal coordination between adjacent intersections into account, and therefore, is able to capture the delay dynamics and uncertainty at intersections. The queue spillback phenomenon is explicitly taken into account by applying shockwave theory in a probabilistic way. The proposed model was further validated with both VISSIM simulation data and field GPS data collected in a Chinese city. The results demonstrate that the travel time distributions derived from the analytical model can well represent those from VISSIM simulation. The comparison with field GPS data shows that the model estimated link and trip travel time distributions can also represent the field travel time distributions, though a small discrepancy can be observed in both middle range travel times and higher travel times. }

    abstract = { Travel times that vehicles experience in urban road networks are intrinsically uncertain because of the stochastic character of delays at signalized intersections. The ability to capture delay characteristics at signalized intersections is critical for estimating and predicting travel times on urban links. Much research has been done to predict travel time on urban links on the basis of traffic state information (e.g., volumes or speeds). However, the results have not been promising. One important reason is that delays experienced by vehicles on urban links are uncertain because of both traffic conditions and traffic control at intersections. This paper addresses the causes of travel time uncertainty. A probabilistic delay distribution model with stochastic arrivals and departures is proposed to investigate delay uncertainty in both undersaturated and oversaturated conditions. The delay distributions with the Poisson arrival process and with the binomial arrival process are compared. Results show that different arrival patterns have little influence on the delay distribution in undersaturated conditions, although they have significant influence on the delay distribution in oversaturated conditions. The delay distributions under different degrees of saturation are overlapping, which indicates that it is difficult to determine the traffic state for a given single-valued delay and vice versa. The “width” of the delay distribution based on percentiles is used to quantify the delay uncertainty at signalized intersections. The dynamics of delay uncertainty and of delay uncertainty under different degrees of saturation are investigated. }

    abstract = { In this paper we discuss stochastic optimal path problems where the goal is to find a path that has minimal expected cost and at the same time is less risky (in terms of travel time) than a given benchmark path. The model is suitable for a risk-averse traveler who prefers a path with a more guaranteed travel time to another path that could be faster but could also be slower. Such risk attitude is incorporated using the concept of second order stochastic dominance constraints. A recently developed theory for optimization problems with stochastic dominance constraints ensures that the resulting problem can be written as a large linear integer program with binary variables; for networks of realistic size, however, such a direct approach is not practical because of the size of the resulting optimization problem. Moreover, the solution returned by the model may contain cycles, which is clearly undesirable from a practical perspective. A number of strategies are explored to solve the problem. First, we prove that cycles can be prevented by a simple modification of the model if the arc travel times are mutually independent. We then propose a sample average approximation approach to the problem using samples from the distribution of travel times. Because of the randomness resulting from sampling, it is important that statistical guarantees for the solution returned by the algorithm be given, and we provide heuristic procedures to deal with stochastic constraints. We also incorporate a branch-and-cut approach that exploits the structure of the problem to deal with the integrality constraints more efficiently. We present some numerical experiments for a 1,522-arc system that corresponds to a large portion of the Chicago area network. The results show that our approach can solve the problem very effectively, producing solutions with statistical guarantees of optimality within a reasonable computational time. }

    abstract = { Information about traffic conditions has traditionally been conveyed to drivers via radio, variable message signs, and, more recently, the Internet and advanced traveler information systems. This has spurred research on how travelers respond to information, how much they are willing to pay for it, and how much they are likely to benefit from it collectively. In this paper, we analyze the decisions of drivers on whether to acquire information and which routes to take on simple congested road networks. Drivers vary in their degrees of risk aversion with respect to travel time. Four information regimes are considered: no information, free information (publicly available at no cost), costly information (publicly available for a fee), and private information (available free to single individuals). Private information is shown to be individually more valuable than either free or costly information while the benefits from free and costly information cannot be ranked in general. Free or costly information can decrease the expected utility of drivers who are very risk averse; with sufficient risk aversion in the population, the aggregate compensating variation for information can be negative. }

    abstract = { All existing day-to-day dynamics of departure time choice at a single bottleneck are unstable, and this has led to doubt over the existence of a stable user equilibrium in the real world. However, empirical observations and our personal driving experience suggest stable stationary congestion patterns during a peak period. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile the discrepancy by presenting a stable day-to-day dynamical system for drivers’ departure time choice at a single bottleneck. In our model, the decision variable in the execution stage is still drivers’ departure times on the next day, but in the planning stage before the execution stage, drivers determine their departure times in order to arrive at the destination at better times with lower scheduling costs. We first define within-day traffic dynamics with the point queue model, costs, the departure time user equilibrium (DTUE), and the arrival time user equilibrium (ATUE). We then identify three behavioral principles in the planning stage: (i) drivers choose their departure and arrival times in a backward fashion (backward choice principle); (ii) after choosing the arrival times, they update their departure times to balance the total costs (cost-balancing principle); (iii) they choose their arrival times to reduce their scheduling costs or gain their scheduling payoffs (scheduling cost–reducing or scheduling payoff–gaining principle). In this sense, drivers’ departure and arrival time choices are driven by their scheduling payoff choice. With a single tube or imaginary road model, we convert the nonlocal day-to-day arrival time shifting problem to a local scheduling payoff shifting problem. After introducing a new variable for the imaginary density, we apply the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) model to describe the day-to-day dynamics of scheduling payoff choice and present splitting and cost-balancing schemes to determine arrival and departure flow rates accordingly. We define the scheduling payoff user equilibrium (SPUE) as the stationary state of the LWR model, formulate a new optimization problem for the SPUE, and prove the global stability of the SPUE and, therefore, ATUE and DTUE by using Lyapunov’s second method in which the objective function in the optimization formulation is the potential function. We also develop the corresponding discrete models for numerical solutions and use one numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the new day-to-day dynamical model. Different from existing ones, the new adjustment mechanism leads to stable day-to-day departure time choice dynamics by guaranteeing that drivers have better choices of departure/arrival times with larger scheduling payoffs on the next day, and such better choices are not over-chosen because of the constraint imposed by the single tube’s cross-section area, which is equal to the jam density in the LWR model. This study is the first step for understanding stable day-to-day dynamics for departure time choice, and many follow-up studies are possible and warranted. }

    abstract = { We address two shortcomings in online travel time estimation methods for congested urban traffic. The first shortcoming is related to the determination of the number of mixture modes, which can change dynamically within a day and from day to day. The second shortcoming is the widespread use of Gaussian probability densities as mixture components. Gaussian densities fail to capture the positive skew in travel time distributions, and consequently, large numbers of mixture components are needed for reasonable fitting accuracy when applied as mixture components. They also assign positive probabilities to negative travel times. To address these issues, this paper derives a mixture distribution with Gamma component densities, which are asymmetric and supported on the positive numbers. We use sparse estimation techniques to ensure parsimonious models and propose a generalization of Gamma mixture densities using Mittag–Leffler functions that provides enhanced fitting flexibility and improved parsimony. In order to accommodate within-day variability and allow for online implementation of the proposed methodology (i.e., fast computations on streaming travel time data), we introduce a recursive algorithm that efficiently updates the fitted distribution whenever new data become available. Experimental results using real-world travel time data illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. }

    abstract = { The paper gives conditions which guarantee the existence of an equilibrium arrival pattern at a single bottleneck. In the model, the times at which a driver wishes to leave the bottleneck depend on the driver. The equilibrium queue length in this model always has a continuous time derivative everywhere. However, the slope of the equilibrium cumulative arrival distribution is discontinuous at the beginning and end of congestion. }

    abstract = { Although reliability of travel modes has generally been found to be one of the most important attributes of transportation systems, few attempts have been made to make these findings operational. The impact of a specific measure of reliability, the variability of travel time, on the route-to-work choice is investigated in this research through the use of a survey instrument posing hypothetical commute alternatives. A mean-variance model of travel choice is used to estimate an individual's tradeoff between time and variability (i.e., risk aversion). The principal tool of analysis was LINMAP, a linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preferences, which yielded estimates of each respondent's risk aversion coefficient (λ). A pretest was conducted to determine an appropriate format for the commute choices and to investigate external validity concerns. }

abstract = {The unavoidable travel time variability in transportation networks, resulted from the widespread supply-side and demand-side uncertainties, makes travel time reliability (TTR) be a common and core interest of all of the stakeholders in transportation systems, including planners, travelers, service providers, and managers. This common and core interest stimulates extensive studies on modeling travel time reliability. Researchers have developed a range of theories and models of TTR, many of which have been incorporated into transportation models, transport policies, and project appraisals. Adopting the network perspective, this paper aims to provide an integrated framework for summarizing the methodological developments of modeling TTR in transportation networks, including its characterization, evaluation and valuation, and traffic assignment. Specifically, the TTR characterization provides a whole picture of travel time distribution in transportation networks; TTR evaluation and TTR valuation (known as the value of reliability, VOR) interpret abstract characterized TTR in a simple and intuitive way in order to be well understood by different stakeholders of transportation systems; and lastly TTR-based traffic assignment investigates the effects of TTR on the individual users’ travel behavior and consequently the collective network flow pattern. As the above three topics are mainly separately studied in different disciplines and research areas, the integrated framework allows to better understand their relationships and may contribute to developing more possible combinations of TTR modeling philosophy. Also, the network perspective enables to pay more attention to some common challenges of modeling TTR in transportation networks, especially the uncertainty propagation from the uncertainty sources to the TTR at various spatial levels including link, route, and the entire network. Some potential directions for future research are discussed in the era of new data environment, applications, and emerging technologies.}

    abstract = { We study the impact of information on risk-averse drivers who maximize their expected utility (rather than minimizing expected travel time). For two routes in parallel with risky travel time, we show that equilibrium travel times depend on the distribution of risk aversion as well as on provision of information. Besides the mean variance model used so far in transportation, we consider three other standard utility functions. Interestingly, we find that optimal route choice may depend on global factors such as the length of the journey. Finally, we study the benefit of information according to the level of risk aversion. }

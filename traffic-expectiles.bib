  abstract = {The efficiency of park and ride (PnR) lots has not been investigated in serious depth in prior literature. This study examines the effect of various factors on the utilization rate of PnR lots with panel Tobit models. The examined factors consist of land use features, roadway design features, transit ridership, sociodemographic attributes, travel characteristics, policy tools, gasoline prices, and weather conditions. The data is drawn from PnR lots in King County, Washington. Results show that: (1) degree of mixed land use, road density, employment density, percentages of people aged between 18 and 34 and people over 65, the percentage of white people, the percentage of poor people, and transit ridership are positively associated with the utilization rate of PnR lots; (2) the percentage of drive lanes in total roadway miles, the percentage of males, and the mode share percentage of driving are negatively correlated with the utilization rate of PnR lots; (3) various policy interventions, including countermeasures for preserving transit after the economic recession, congestion reduction charge, and bus-rail integration, are all positively correlated with the utilization rate of PnR lots. Contextualized to US cities, PnR is a practical way to attract bus riders, especially young adults, senior citizens, and low-income people to public transit. Dense urban development is encouraged for the full utilization of PnR lots. Additionally, the integration between bus and rail appears to be an effective policy tool to promote PnR utilization.},

The objective of the model is to maximise the total social welfare, which includes consumer surplus and operator's net profit. The model is solved by a heuristic solution procedure and tested on an idealized linear travel corridor. The case study considers the effects from population density, density distribution, size of residential area, P\&R station location, distance from the residential area to centre business area (CBD), as well as the changes of residential area layout and population growth. Results show that P\&R fits for low population density area while ODPB is more suitable for high population density area. Population distribution type has little influence on the services' social welfare. ODPB is a preferable service for the city which does not have advanced metro network. Besides, the investment time for building ODPB service in the planning horizon is discussed with consideration of the development of residential area.},

Five different types of models are estimated and analysed, namely a traditional Revealed Preference (RP) data-based mode choice model, a hybrid mode choice model with a latent variable, a Stated Preference (SP) data-based mode switching model, a joint RP/SP mode switching model, and a hybrid mode switching model with a latent variable. A comparison of the RP data-based mode choice model with the mode choice models including a latent variable showed that the inclusion of behavioural factors (especially habit formation) significantly improved the models. The SP data-based mode switching models elucidated the reasons why traditional models tend to over-predict transit ridership by revealing the role played by different transit level-of-service attributes and their relative importance to mode switching decisions. The results showed that traditional attributes (e.g. travel cost and time) are of lower importance to mode switching behaviour than behavioural factors (e.g. habit formation towards car driving) and other transit service design attributes (e.g. crowding level, number of transfers, and schedule delays). The findings of this study provide general guidelines for developing a variety of transit ridership forecasting models depending on the availability of data and the experience of the planner.},

P\&R is an intermodal connection point between private vehicles and public transport, and therefore is considered a fundamental element in transport planning. The planning of a P\&R system is linked to numerous parameters related to transport planning, such as origin and purpose of travel in the P\&R system, P\&R location problem, P\&R and potential demand, P\&R and catchment area, P\&R and public transport, and P\&R in the future transportation (autonomous, electric vehicles). Thus, the planning process becomes essential for the successful implementation of the P\&R system. However, most studies have shown each part of the planning process separately. Therefore, the researchers in this paper have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the available literature on P\&R system planning, and studies that consider the planning sections separately are to be part of the complete research. In conclusion, the planning of P\&R facilities should not be regarded as a separate mobility design element. Instead, it should be viewed as an essential component integrated into the city's urban environment.},

  abstract = {We propose an Integrated Stochastic Equilibrium model that considers both private automobile traffic and transit networks to incorporate the interactions between these two modes in terms of travel time and generalized costs. In addition, in the general version of the model, travelers are allowed to switch from personal vehicles to mass transit at specific locations in a park-and-ride scheme. The assignment for traffic equilibrium is based on the Markovian Traffic Equilibrium model of Baillon and Cominetti (2008), whereas the equilibrium of the transit network is represented by the Stochastic Transit Equilibrium model of Cort{\'e}s et al. (2013). Stochastic travel decisions are made at the node level, thereby avoiding the enumeration of routes or strategies and incorporating various perception and uncertainty issues. We propose a Method-of-Successive-Averages algorithm to calculate an Integrated Stochastic Equilibrium and conduct numerical experiments to highlight the effect of stochasticity on equilibrium flows and travel times. Our experiments show that higher stochasticity implies greater dispersion of equilibrium flows and longer expected travel times. Results on a real network with mode combination and park and ride facilities provide insights regarding the use of park and ride in terms of number and location, potential modal share of the combined mode option under different circumstances, and travel time impact due to the implementation of such park and ride facilities in a real setting.},

  abstract = {It is well known that faster and less-expensive transit systems with shorter walking distances, as well as less transfers, are associated with transit use. In this regard, recent studies have focused on estimating transit's competitiveness and further suggested possible policy interventions. However, there were not much attention on measuring travel time and cost differences between transit and auto by considering the temporal variability. In addition, only a limited study have focused on the impact of either walking during transfers on mode choice or the stage of walking that most affects mode choice. This paper provides additional insights into the impact of travel time, cost, and transit burdens on commute mode choice based on the analysis in a transit-oriented mega city, Seoul, Korea. Together with the 2016 household travel survey data, we utilize the web-based route guide information to measure time, cost, and transit burdens for both chosen and non-chosen modes. The results reveal that commuters are significantly affected by the travel time and cost difference between modes. Additionally, the results indicate that the odds of driving increases by 4.7\% and 24.3\% when commuters have to transfer once or more than once, respectively. Also, commuters were mostly disinclined to walk longer distances during transfer and egress. The effect of time, cost, and transit burdens on mode choice also varied by income and age groups, further implying the group of people that should be focused when devising policies to encourage transit use. To conclude, this paper suggests potential levers for transportation policies to trigger modal shifts toward sustainable modes by using advanced data sources that better estimate the travel characteristics by departure time based on a point-to-point travel survey data.},

  abstract = {Bike-sharing systems (BSS) have arisen worldwide as an attractive and sustainable travel alternative. As these systems have shown positive effects in reducing congestion and emissions, it is relevant to properly analyze their potential implementation in different contexts. Evidence has shown that BSS can only provide benefits when their network is adequately designed, in order to capture ridership and generate demand. This study proposes an integrated approach to model the demand of bike-sharing trips and the optimal location of stations in the system, based on built environment and accessibility-based variables. The methodology consists of two steps. On the first step, trip generation models are estimated through multiple regressions for different types of trips and periods of the week. On the second step, maximum demand coverage models are developed to allocate the BSS stations, according to the trip generation models and to different proposed scenarios. To test the proposed methodology, information from the BSS of Santiago de Chile is used. Results suggest a relationship between the built environment and the use of public bicycles, with a main effect of residential and office land uses, and the presence of long bicycle lanes near the stations. In addition, the presence of endogeneity, associated with the location of BSS stations and BSS demand generation, is confirmed and controlled using accessibility variables. As for the optimal location models, their outcomes differ significantly from the observed spatial distribution of stations in Santiago, with higher density in central areas and along corridors with cycling infrastructure. The forecasted demand level for the optimal distribution of stations is 64\% higher than the observed demand. This study confirms the benefit of an integrated modelling of the trip generation and the station location to foster higher public bicycle usage, a relevant point for BSS decision planning and the promotion of a more sustainable mobility.},

A growing number of studies have been mining bike-sharing data from different cities to understand bike-sharing systems. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of a bike-sharing network structure. Thus, this paper attempts to use complex network theory and spatial autocorrelation analysis approaches to examine structural properties of bike-sharing systems, quantify the importance of bike stations in the network, and evaluate their spatial clustering patterns. This research analyzes bike-sharing trip data from five different sized bike-sharing systems in the United States, Canada, and China. The results of network analysis reveal that the bike-sharing networks have a small-world property with a small average path length and a high clustering coefficient. Compared with medium-scale networks, the connectivity and accessibility of bike stations are relatively low in the large-scale bike-sharing network. Also, the connectivity of bike stations is positively related to their accessibility while they are not highly correlated with their intermediateness. The spatial clustering analysis results indicate that the spatial distributions of connectivity and accessibility of bike stations have a strong global spatial autocorrelation. Also, the stations with high connectivity and accessibility are concentrated in the urban centers, and the stations with low connectivity and accessibility are clustered in the periphery of the urban areas. However, their intermediateness does not show a strong global spatial clustering pattern, which implies that bike-sharing networks consist of multiple sub-groups. The findings provide new insights for transport planners and managers to understand bike-sharing systems and to improve their service quality.},

  abstract = {In recent years, travel time reliability has become one of the key performance indicators of transportation networks and corridors around the globe. Travel time reliability indicators are mostly related to properties of the day-to-day travel time distribution on for example a freeway corridor. On the basis of empirical data a number of key characteristics of this day-to-day distribution can be identified. Most importantly, this distribution is not only very wide but also heavily skewed. The (economic) consequences of this skew are substantial. For example, it is shown that in some peak periods the 5\% most ``unlucky drivers'' incur almost five times as much delay as the 50\% most fortunate travelers. We argue this implies first of all that (besides the variance of travel times) skew must be considered an important contributing factor to travel time unreliability. Secondly, it suggests that most of currently used unreliability measures (which are predominantly based on travel time variance), should be used and interpreted with some reservations, since they only account for a part of the costs (that is, delays) of unreliability. This is further substantiated by a comparison on the basis of empirical data from a densely used freeway in the Netherlands between a new travel time reliability measure based on both width and skew, and a number of travel time reliability measures commonly used in practice. The analysis clearly illustrates the inconsistency between all measures, both old and new. In illustration, in cases where the commonly used misery index dubs a particular departure period very unreliable, another common measure (buffer time) considers these periods relatively reliable. Although without objective and quantitative criteria (e.g. economic or societal costs) a choice for any of these measures in road network performance analyses will remain subject to debate, this article provides empirically underpinned arguments to prefer measures incorporating the skew of the travel time distribution.},

The proposed approach is able to analyze the economic benefit for every single bike-sharing trip and investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the economic benefits from FFBS. An empirical analysis in Shanghai is conducted using the proposed approach. The estimated saved travel time, cost, and economic benefit due to using FFBS per trip are estimated to be 9.95~min, 3.64 CNY, and 8.68 CNY-eq, respectively. The annual saved travel time, cost, and economic benefits from FFBS in Shanghai are estimated to be 17.665 billion min, 6.463 billion CNY, and 15.410 billion CNY-eq, respectively. The relationships between economic benefits from FFBS and built environment factors in different urban contexts are quantitatively examined using Multiple Linear Regression to explain the spatial heterogeneity in the economic benefits of FFBS. The outcomes provide a useful tool for evaluating the benefits of shared mobility systems, insights into the users' economic benefit from using FFBS from per-trip, aggregated and spatial perspective, as well as its influencing factors. The results could efficiently support the scientific planning, operation and policy making concerning FFBS in different urban contexts.},

Numerical studies were conducted to demonstrate the impact of availability and accessibility on the net profit of the bike-sharing company and the carbon dioxide emissions of the transit vehicles and buses. The results show that by considering the effects of availability and accessibility, the operator can both make more net profit and reduce potential carbon dioxide emissions. Besides, the potential demand coverage also increases.

  abstract = {The measurement of transportation system reliability has become one of the central topics of travel demand studies. A growing literature concerns the measurement of value of travel time reliability which provides a monetary cost of avoiding unpredictable travel time. The goal of this study is to measure commuters' sensitivities to travel time reliability and their willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid unreliable routes. The preferences are elicited through a pivoted stated preference survey technique. To circumvent the issue of presenting numerical distributions and statistical terms to day-to-day commuters, we use the frequency of delay days as a means of measuring traveler's sensitivities to travel time reliability. The advantage of using simplified measures to elicit traveler preferences for travel time reliability is that these methods simply compare days with high delay to days with usual travel time. It was found that travelers are not only averse to the amount of unexpected delay but also to the frequency of days with unexpected delays. The paper presents WTP findings for three measures: travel time, frequency embedded travel time, and travel time reliability. The `reliability' increase in WTP for travel time is found to be nearly proportional to the frequency of experiencing unexpected delays. For example, the WTP for mean travel time is calculated at \$6.98/h; however, reliability adds \$3.27 (about 50~\% of \$6.98) to avoid unexpected delays `5 out of 10~days'. The results of the study would provide valuable inputs to cost-benefit analyses and traffic and revenue studies required for road tolling investment projects.},

Quantile regression not only provides a method of estimating the conditional quantiles (thus the conditional distribution) of conventional time series models but also substantially expands the modeling options for time series analysis by allowing for local, quantile-specific time series dynamics. The traditional least square-based methods provide estimation for the conditional mean function. In many statistical applications, the research question is more complicate than just a few moments, and there may be valuable information about the relationship between random variables that cannot be discovered based on a simple conditional mean analysis. Quantile regression-based methods provide a complementary way to study the relationship between random variables. This chapter considers a wide range of time series quantile regression models. Quantile regressions on traditional time series models, quantile-domain local dynamic models, and time series applications are discussed.},

Surprisingly, the question of how expectiles may be efficiently calculated has been left largely untouched. We fill this gap by, first, providing a general outlook on the computation of expectiles that relies on the knowledge of analytic expressions of the underlying distribution function and mean residual life function. We distinguish between discrete distributions, for which an exact calculation is always feasible, and continuous distributions, where a Newton--Raphson approximation algorithm can be implemented and a list of exceptional distributions whose expectiles are in analytic form can be given. When the distribution function and/or the mean residual life is difficult to compute, Monte-Carlo algorithms are introduced, based on an exact calculation of sample expectiles and on the use of control variates to improve computational efficiency. We discuss the relevance of our findings to statistical practice and provide numerical evidence of the performance of the considered methods.},

The decisive attributes considered are average travel time, travel time reliability, cost and in-vehicle crowding. Five model specifications are defined for the parameter estimations. Significant interaction effects between in-vehicle crowding and travel time are found. Time multipliers are defined to represent the effects of in-vehicle crowding. In contrast, no evidence could be established for the interaction between in-vehicle crowding and travel time reliability. Results of the mode-specific valuations of travel time reliability and in-vehicle crowding, vary remarkably across the four different transport modes. In the mode-specific models, the range of time multipliers is estimated to be [1.44, 2.00]. Besides, demand estimates would be biased when the mode-specific willingness to pay (WTP) is ignored. For instance, the mode share of metro will be underestimated when its reliability level is high, and vice versa. This suggests that mode-specific WTP of travel time reliability and in-vehicle crowding should be considered in the demand estimations and in the earlier stage of public transport project appraisal.},

This insight provides a unification of the scheduling model and models that include the standard deviation of trip duration directly as an argument in the cost or utility function. The results generalise approximately to the case where the mean and standard deviation of trip duration depend on the starting time. An empirical illustration is provided.}

abstract = {The reliability of travel time significantly affects individual travelers’ decision-making behaviour and hence in turn influences the overall travel demand at the macroscopic level. The travel time reliability ratio (TTRR), defined to be the ratio of the value of travel time variability to the value of travel time, is an important metric for measuring such reliability. In this paper, we first show that the TTRR is closely related to a widely used risk measure in financial economics, i.e. conditional value at risk (CVaR). Then based on the connection between the TTRR and CVaR, we develop a nonparametric approach to estimate the TTRR. In the literature, to compute the TTRR, it usually needs to assume a specific statistical distribution for the travel time. This can produce a misleading result when this assumption goes awry due to the potential complexity of travel time distributions. Based on the relationship between the TTRR and CVaR, this paper proposes a new nonparametric method, i.e. the kernel density estimation method, to overcome this problem. We show that this new nonparametric method is robust in terms that it does not depend on any assumptions about the shape of the travel time distribution. The simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and substantially improves the numerical accuracy. Finally, a practical example is used to illustrate the proposed method.}

It can be seen as a dimension reduction tool for extreme-value theory, where fluctuations in the τ-expectile level of the data are approximated by a low-dimensional subspace. We provide algorithms based on iterative least squares, derive bounds on their convergence time, and compare their performance through simulations. We apply the algorithms to a Chinese weather dataset and fMRI data from an investment decision study.}

The impact of a specific measure of reliability, the variability of travel time, on the route-to-work choice is investigated in this research through the use of a survey instrument posing hypothetical commute alternatives. A mean-variance model of travel choice is used to estimate an individual's tradeoff between time and variability (i.e., risk aversion). The principal tool of analysis was LINMAP, a linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preferences, which yielded estimates of each respondent's risk aversion coefficient (λ). A pretest was conducted to determine an appropriate format for the commute choices and to investigate external validity concerns. }

    abstract = { Travelers sometimes experience extremely long travel times on a route. The Travel Simulator Laboratory (TSL) of Delft University of Technology is used to study the effect of these extreme experiences on route choice. The TSL allows for a completely controlled experiment and good research methodology. It is hypothesized that together with the average travel time and the variance, the most extreme travel times experienced influence a person's perception of the attractiveness of the route. Travel information is assumed to be able to alter this perception. Data from 2,500 respondents were gathered with the TSL. Route switching behavior after a regular experience and after an extreme experience was analyzed. People switched routes after an extreme experience significantly more often when the information that they received before the route choice was wrong than they did when it was correct. Moreover, travelers clearly preferred a route that is sometimes bad and most of the time good over a route that is symmetrically distributed with a large variance and thus less predictable. Furthermore, mixed multinomial logit models for panel data were estimated. Expected travel time, expected variance, and worst experience were found to be negatively valued. The posed hypothesis seems to be correct on a qualitative level and proves to be a promising field of research. However, much work still has to be done on the mathematical model to draw more specific conclusions on a quantitative level as well. }

This study aims at establishing relationships between speed and volume in freeway sections using Remote Traffic Microwave Sensor (RTMS) data as a function of weather conditions. Historical weather and RTMS detector data (i.e., volume and speed) from two highway corridors in the Istanbul metropolitan area are used for this purpose. Empirical relationships between traffic speed and volume are analyzed by weather condition (clear, rain, fog/mist/haze, or snow), surface condition (dry, wet, or icy), and percentage of heavy vehicles in the traffic mix. The findings from the analysis show that rain reduced the average vehicular speeds by 8 to 12% and the capacity by 7-8%. Moreover, wet surface conditions resulted in a reduction of average speeds by 6 to 7% and light snow affected demand leading to a significant reduction in traffic volume.}

The influence of freeway traffic flow characteristics caused by different rainfall intensity was quantified through collecting the Hainan Province Eastern Freeway traffic flow and rainfall data. The speed and density distribution of microscopic parameters about freeway traffic flow under different rains was researched, and the highway two-regime speed density distribution traffic flow model under different rainfall weather conditions was calibrated. Besides, the weather influence coefficient that the rainfall intensity and visibility affect the freeway traffic flow model parameters was determined through regression analysis. The research indicates that it has an greater influence on the maximum highway volume and free flow speed as the rainfall intensity increases. Compared with the normal weather, the maximum flow rate decreases15.7%, 19.1%, 32.5% respectively and the free flow speed decreases 4.4%, 7.3%,10.6% respectively because of light rain, moderate rain and heavy rain weather conditions. In the traffic flow model, the breakpoint density and the speed-intercept of traffic flow model are not obviously relevant with the rainfall intensity.}

The study site is located in a cold region highway in Alberta, Canada. The road-weather and traffic data collection devices are located alongside, permitting accurate measurement and association of exact pertaining road-weather and traffic conditions. The study has two main objectives: i) to investigate and model the impacts of road-weather events on the free-flow speed of vehicles, and ii) to explore the variability in models caused by adopting different data treatment methods. Linear and nonlinear regression models were developed with separate models for light and heavy vehicles travelling in shoulder and median lanes. Linear regression models developed with 20-minute aggregated free-flow speeds as dependent variable was found to be the best performing model for describing drivers’ choice of desired speed under adverse road-weather conditions. The study results revealed that slight, moderate and heavy snow will respectively reduce the free-flow speed of light vehicles travelling in the shoulder lane by 0.2%, 3.4% and 0.8%, and by 0.3%, 0.4% and 1.5% when travelling in the median lane. Moreover, heavy vehicles travelling in slight, moderate and heavy snow were estimated to reduce their desired speeds by 1.7%, 0.1% and 1.3% in shoulder lane while the reduction factors for those travelling in slight and moderate snow in median lane was 1.1% and 1% respectively. Estimated reduction factors for free-flow speed variations under adverse road-weather conditions found to be significantly smaller than HCM (2016) recommendations and the findings of other studies. These figures signify the importance of winter road maintenance in extremely cold regions. The frequent snow and ice removal as a result of winter road maintenance operations obviates the need for reducing desired speed and eventually results in less weather-related delays. The significance of driver familiarity with prevailing geographical conditions, i.e. winter driving was also highlighted when investigating the impact of inclement road-weather conditions on traffic operations.}

    abstract = { Travel time estimation models, which rely on speed data provided from point detectors (usually inductive loops), have application in travel time prediction and network performance monitoring. Unfortunately there are limited, and at times counterintuitive, results in the literature about their performance. This paper focuses on the field evaluation of four speed-based travel time estimation models, namely, the instantaneous model, the time slice model, the dynamic time slice model, and the linear model. Those models are evaluated using data from two operational motorways in Melbourne, Australia. Travel time estimation errors are quantified against actual travel times measured using a timed number plate survey and time-stamped toll tag data. There was little difference in the travel time estimation error across the models and they were all found to underestimate actual travel times. Errors ranged from about 7\% in the off peak up to 15\% in the peak. Marginal improvements in model performance were achieved through careful selection of which detectors provide input for each section (upstream, downstream, or the average of those values) and by conversion of the inputs from time mean speed to an estimate of space mean speed. }

    abstract = { Recent interest in modern regression modelling has focused on extending available (mean) regression models by describing more general properties of the response distribution. An alternative approach is quantile regression where regression effects on the conditional quantile function of the response are assumed. While quantile regression can be seen as a generalization of median regression, expectiles as alternative are a generalized form of mean regression.Generally, quantiles provide a natural interpretation even beyond the 0.5 quantile, the median. A comparable simple interpretation is not available for expectiles beyond the 0.5 expectile, the mean. Nonetheless, expectiles have some interesting properties, some of which are discussed in this article. We contrast the two approaches and show how to get quantiles from a fine grid of expectiles. We compare such quantiles from expectiles with direct quantile estimates regarding efficiency. We also look at regression problems where both quantile and expectile curves have the undesirable property that neighbouring curves may cross each other. We propose a modified method to estimate non-crossing expectile curves based on splines. In an application, we look at the expected shortfall, a risk measure used in finance, which requires both expectiles and quantiles for estimation and which can be calculated easily with the proposed methods in the article. }

    abstract = { Under relatively general assumptions a unique deterministic departure-time user equilibrium with a finite departure rate exists in the bottleneck model with drivers who differ in their unit costs of travel time, preferred times of arrival, and schedule delay cost functions. Existence requires that schedule delay cost functions be upper semicontinuous with respect to arrival time, and that schedule delay costs decline at a rate smaller than the unit cost of travel time. Uniqueness requires, more restrictively, that schedule delay cost functions be continuous. Several properties of equilibrium trip cost functions are derived for n groups of users with Ni in group i. The trip cost of a user in group i is a nondecreasing function of each Nj, but typically rises more quickly with respect to Ni than Nj, j≠i. Thus, users experience lower trip costs when they travel with users unlike themselves than with an equal number of users like themselves. }

Fosgerau's valuation method includes the consideration of travel time reliability in cost-benefit analysis by adding travel time variability to the set of generalised travel costs. This requires: (1) a defined unit of measurement for travel time variability, (2) estimates of the quantity of travel time variability, and (3) identification of the cost to travellers per unit of travel time variability. The chosen unit of measurement is the standard deviation of the travel time distribution, and the value of this unit of measurement can be defined relative to the average value of travel time by a reliability ratio that depends on user preference parameters (related to risk aversion) and the shape of the upper tail of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the travel time distribution. This shape is represented by a definite integral of the inverse of the cdf. Determining the shape of the cdf and its inverse function is facilitated if the distribution can be defined by an explicit algebraic function. The Burr (type XII) distribution is one distribution with this feature, and has been used to successfully represent observed travel time data. This paper describes the Burr distribution, demonstrates that it can provide a good representation of observed travel time data, and explains how it can be used to develop an exact expression for the reliability ratio and thus can aid the use of the method for the valuation of travel time reliability.}

abstract = {The standard method of estimating the value of travel time variability for use in policy appraisal is to estimate the parameters of a reduced-form utility function, where some measure of travel time variability (such as the standard deviation) is included. A problem with this approach is that the obtained valuation will in general depend on the standardized travel time distribution, and hence cannot be transferred from one context to another. A recently suggested remedy for this problem has been to estimate a scheduling model, which in theory is transferrable, and use the implied reduced-form to derive valuations for use in appraisal. In this paper we estimate both a scheduling model and the implied reduced-form model, using stated choice data. The valuation of travel time variability implied by the scheduling model turns out to be substantially smaller than what is obtained from a reduced-form model estimated on the same sample. The results suggest that the scheduling model does not capture all of the disutility arising from travel time variability. Hence, although it can be shown that scheduling and reduced-form models are theoretically equivalent, that hypothesized equivalence is not reflected in the empirical evidence. We speculate that the derivation of reduced-form models from an underlying scheduling model omits two essential features: first, the notion of an exogenously fixed “preferred arrival time” neglects the fact that most activities can be rescheduled given full information about the travel times in advance, and second, disutility may be derived from uncertainty as such, in the form of anxiety, decisions costs or costs for having contingency plans. We also report our estimates of the valuation of travel time variability for public transit trips, for use in applied appraisal.}

    abstract = { Urban travel times are rather variable as a result of a lot of stochastic factors both in traffic flows, signals, and other conditions on the infrastructure. However, the most common way both in literature and practice is to estimate or predict only expected travel times, not travel time distributions. By doing so, it fails to provide full insight into the travel time dynamics and variability on urban roads. Another limitation of this common approach is that the effect of traffic measures on travel time reliability cannot be evaluated. In this paper, an analytical travel time distribution model is presented especially for urban roads with fixed-time controlled intersections by investigating the underlying mechanisms of urban travel times. Different from mean travel time models or deterministic travel time models, the proposed model takes stochastic properties of traffic flow, stochastic arrivals and departures at intersections, and traffic signal coordination between adjacent intersections into account, and therefore, is able to capture the delay dynamics and uncertainty at intersections. The queue spillback phenomenon is explicitly taken into account by applying shockwave theory in a probabilistic way. The proposed model was further validated with both VISSIM simulation data and field GPS data collected in a Chinese city. The results demonstrate that the travel time distributions derived from the analytical model can well represent those from VISSIM simulation. The comparison with field GPS data shows that the model estimated link and trip travel time distributions can also represent the field travel time distributions, though a small discrepancy can be observed in both middle range travel times and higher travel times. }

    abstract = { Travel times that vehicles experience in urban road networks are intrinsically uncertain because of the stochastic character of delays at signalized intersections. The ability to capture delay characteristics at signalized intersections is critical for estimating and predicting travel times on urban links. Much research has been done to predict travel time on urban links on the basis of traffic state information (e.g., volumes or speeds). However, the results have not been promising. One important reason is that delays experienced by vehicles on urban links are uncertain because of both traffic conditions and traffic control at intersections. This paper addresses the causes of travel time uncertainty. A probabilistic delay distribution model with stochastic arrivals and departures is proposed to investigate delay uncertainty in both undersaturated and oversaturated conditions. The delay distributions with the Poisson arrival process and with the binomial arrival process are compared. Results show that different arrival patterns have little influence on the delay distribution in undersaturated conditions, although they have significant influence on the delay distribution in oversaturated conditions. The delay distributions under different degrees of saturation are overlapping, which indicates that it is difficult to determine the traffic state for a given single-valued delay and vice versa. The “width” of the delay distribution based on percentiles is used to quantify the delay uncertainty at signalized intersections. The dynamics of delay uncertainty and of delay uncertainty under different degrees of saturation are investigated. }

    abstract = { In this paper we discuss stochastic optimal path problems where the goal is to find a path that has minimal expected cost and at the same time is less risky (in terms of travel time) than a given benchmark path. The model is suitable for a risk-averse traveler who prefers a path with a more guaranteed travel time to another path that could be faster but could also be slower. Such risk attitude is incorporated using the concept of second order stochastic dominance constraints. A recently developed theory for optimization problems with stochastic dominance constraints ensures that the resulting problem can be written as a large linear integer program with binary variables; for networks of realistic size, however, such a direct approach is not practical because of the size of the resulting optimization problem. Moreover, the solution returned by the model may contain cycles, which is clearly undesirable from a practical perspective. A number of strategies are explored to solve the problem. First, we prove that cycles can be prevented by a simple modification of the model if the arc travel times are mutually independent. We then propose a sample average approximation approach to the problem using samples from the distribution of travel times. Because of the randomness resulting from sampling, it is important that statistical guarantees for the solution returned by the algorithm be given, and we provide heuristic procedures to deal with stochastic constraints. We also incorporate a branch-and-cut approach that exploits the structure of the problem to deal with the integrality constraints more efficiently. We present some numerical experiments for a 1,522-arc system that corresponds to a large portion of the Chicago area network. The results show that our approach can solve the problem very effectively, producing solutions with statistical guarantees of optimality within a reasonable computational time. }

    abstract = { Information about traffic conditions has traditionally been conveyed to drivers via radio, variable message signs, and, more recently, the Internet and advanced traveler information systems. This has spurred research on how travelers respond to information, how much they are willing to pay for it, and how much they are likely to benefit from it collectively. In this paper, we analyze the decisions of drivers on whether to acquire information and which routes to take on simple congested road networks. Drivers vary in their degrees of risk aversion with respect to travel time. Four information regimes are considered: no information, free information (publicly available at no cost), costly information (publicly available for a fee), and private information (available free to single individuals). Private information is shown to be individually more valuable than either free or costly information while the benefits from free and costly information cannot be ranked in general. Free or costly information can decrease the expected utility of drivers who are very risk averse; with sufficient risk aversion in the population, the aggregate compensating variation for information can be negative. }

In our model, the decision variable in the execution stage is still drivers’ departure times on the next day, but in the planning stage before the execution stage, drivers determine their departure times in order to arrive at the destination at better times with lower scheduling costs. We first define within-day traffic dynamics with the point queue model, costs, the departure time user equilibrium (DTUE), and the arrival time user equilibrium (ATUE). We then identify three behavioral principles in the planning stage: (i) drivers choose their departure and arrival times in a backward fashion (backward choice principle); (ii) after choosing the arrival times, they update their departure times to balance the total costs (cost-balancing principle); (iii) they choose their arrival times to reduce their scheduling costs or gain their scheduling payoffs (scheduling cost–reducing or scheduling payoff–gaining principle). In this sense, drivers’ departure and arrival time choices are driven by their scheduling payoff choice. With a single tube or imaginary road model, we convert the nonlocal day-to-day arrival time shifting problem to a local scheduling payoff shifting problem. After introducing a new variable for the imaginary density, we apply the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) model to describe the day-to-day dynamics of scheduling payoff choice and present splitting and cost-balancing schemes to determine arrival and departure flow rates accordingly. We define the scheduling payoff user equilibrium (SPUE) as the stationary state of the LWR model, formulate a new optimization problem for the SPUE, and prove the global stability of the SPUE and, therefore, ATUE and DTUE by using Lyapunov’s second method in which the objective function in the optimization formulation is the potential function. We also develop the corresponding discrete models for numerical solutions and use one numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the new day-to-day dynamical model. Different from existing ones, the new adjustment mechanism leads to stable day-to-day departure time choice dynamics by guaranteeing that drivers have better choices of departure/arrival times with larger scheduling payoffs on the next day, and such better choices are not over-chosen because of the constraint imposed by the single tube’s cross-section area, which is equal to the jam density in the LWR model. This study is the first step for understanding stable day-to-day dynamics for departure time choice, and many follow-up studies are possible and warranted. }

    abstract = { We address two shortcomings in online travel time estimation methods for congested urban traffic. The first shortcoming is related to the determination of the number of mixture modes, which can change dynamically within a day and from day to day. The second shortcoming is the widespread use of Gaussian probability densities as mixture components. Gaussian densities fail to capture the positive skew in travel time distributions, and consequently, large numbers of mixture components are needed for reasonable fitting accuracy when applied as mixture components. They also assign positive probabilities to negative travel times. To address these issues, this paper derives a mixture distribution with Gamma component densities, which are asymmetric and supported on the positive numbers. We use sparse estimation techniques to ensure parsimonious models and propose a generalization of Gamma mixture densities using Mittag–Leffler functions that provides enhanced fitting flexibility and improved parsimony. In order to accommodate within-day variability and allow for online implementation of the proposed methodology (i.e., fast computations on streaming travel time data), we introduce a recursive algorithm that efficiently updates the fitted distribution whenever new data become available. Experimental results using real-world travel time data illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. }

This estimator is robust if ψ is bounded. In this paper, we develop a generalization of the M-concept to estimation of a quantile analogue of Θ, called a M-quantile, by introducing a particular kind of asymmetry into ψ. A natural consequence is that the M- quantile parameter then bears the same relationship to Θ as the ordinary quantile bears to the median. The extension of this idea to the case of multivariate data is considered in some detail. Two applications to the analysis of agricultural survey data are given.},

abstract = {The unavoidable travel time variability in transportation networks, resulted from the widespread supply-side and demand-side uncertainties, makes travel time reliability (TTR) be a common and core interest of all of the stakeholders in transportation systems, including planners, travelers, service providers, and managers. This common and core interest stimulates extensive studies on modeling travel time reliability. Researchers have developed a range of theories and models of TTR, many of which have been incorporated into transportation models, transport policies, and project appraisals. Adopting the network perspective, this paper aims to provide an integrated framework for summarizing the methodological developments of modeling TTR in transportation networks, including its characterization, evaluation and valuation, and traffic assignment. Specifically, the TTR characterization provides a whole picture of travel time distribution in transportation networks; TTR evaluation and TTR valuation (known as the value of reliability, VOR) interpret abstract characterized TTR in a simple and intuitive way in order to be well understood by different stakeholders of transportation systems; and lastly TTR-based traffic assignment investigates the effects of TTR on the individual users’ travel behavior and consequently the collective network flow pattern. As the above three topics are mainly separately studied in different disciplines and research areas, the integrated framework allows to better understand their relationships and may contribute to developing more possible combinations of TTR modeling philosophy. Also, the network perspective enables to pay more attention to some common challenges of modeling TTR in transportation networks, especially the uncertainty propagation from the uncertainty sources to the TTR at various spatial levels including link, route, and the entire network. Some potential directions for future research are discussed in the era of new data environment, applications, and emerging technologies.}

For two routes in parallel with risky travel time, we show that equilibrium travel times depend on the distribution of risk aversion as well as on provision of information. Besides the mean variance model used so far in transportation, we consider three other standard utility functions. Interestingly, we find that optimal route choice may depend on global factors such as the length of the journey. Finally, we study the benefit of information according to the level of risk aversion. }

abstract = {Recent empirical studies have found that travellers route choices deviate from perfect rationality, showing that urban trips do not necessary follow the shortest-time routes. However, there is no consent on how much the travellers’ route choice behaviour deviates from the perfect rational assumption. The objective of this study is to contribute to the understanding on how travellers process travel time when making route choices, and to quantify to what extent users are strict travel time minimisers or if bounded rationality is observed. The question of whether travellers evaluate travel time differences in absolute or relative terms is also addressed, and the heterogeneity in the route choice behaviour of travellers investigated. The results of route choice experiments, focused on the choices in diverse OD pairs and traffic conditions, are analysed. In total, 496 participants recorded 5535 choices over 41 OD pairs. It was found that travellers evaluate relative rather than absolute differences in travel time. In 60.5% of the trips participants chose the fastest route, but this percentage is 80% when the travel time between the fastest and the rest of the alternatives is at least 30% higher. Only 10% of the individuals chose the fastest route in all trips, confirming the hypothesis of bounded rationality. Participants exhibited heterogeneous travel time indifference bands: the average participant was indifferent to relative travel time differences of less than 31%. A mixed logit model (MXL), considering heterogeneous indifference bands is proposed. The model shows a similar predictive accuracy compared to the classical MXL model.}
